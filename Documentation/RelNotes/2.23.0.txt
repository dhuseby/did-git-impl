Git 2.23 Release Notes
======================

Updates since v2.22
-------------------

Backward compatibility note

 * The "--base" option of "format-patch" computed the patch-ids for
   prerequisite patches in an unstable way, which has been updated to
   compute in a way that is compatible with "git patch-id --stable".


UI, Workflows & Features

 * The "git fast-export/import" pair has been taught to handle commits
   with log messages in encoding other than UTF-8 better.

 * In recent versions of Git, per-worktree refs are exposed in
   refs/worktrees/<wtname>/ hierarchy, which means that worktree names
   must be a valid refname component.  The code now sanitizes the names
   given to worktrees, to make sure these refs are well-formed.

 * "git merge" learned "--quit" option that cleans up the in-progress
   merge while leaving the working tree and the index still in a mess.

 * "git format-patch" learns a configuration to set the default for
   its --notes=<ref> option.

 * The code to show args with potential typo that cannot be
   interpreted as a commit-ish has been improved.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * Update supporting parts of "git rebase" to remove code that should
   no longer be used.

 * Developer support to emulate unsatisfied prerequisites in tests to
   ensure that the remainer of the tests still succeeds when tests
   with prerequisites are skipped.

 * "git update-server-info" learned not to rewrite the file with the
   same contents.

 * The way of specifying the path to find dynamic libraries at runtime
   has been simplified.  The old default to pass -R/path/to/dir has been
   replaced with the new default to pass -Wl,-rpath,/path/to/dir,
   which is the more recent GCC uses.  Those who need to build with an
   old GCC can still use "CC_LD_DYNPATH=-R"


Fixes since v2.22
-----------------

 * A relative pathname given to "git init --template=<path> <repo>"
   ought to be relative to the directory "git init" gets invoked in,
   but it instead was made relative to the repository, which has been
   corrected.
   (merge e1df7fe43f nd/init-relative-template-fix later to maint).

 * "git worktree add" used to fail when another worktree connected to
   the same repository was corrupt, which has been corrected.
   (merge 105df73e71 nd/corrupt-worktrees later to maint).

 * The ownership rule for the file descriptor to fast-import remote
   backend was mixed up, leading to unrelated file descriptor getting
   closed, which has been fixed.
   (merge 3203566a71 mh/import-transport-fd-fix later to maint).

 * A "merge -c" instruction during "git rebase --rebase-merges" should
   give the user a chance to edit the log message, even when there is
   otherwise no need to create a new merge and replace the existing
   one (i.e. fast-forward instead), but did not.  Which has been
   corrected.

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
